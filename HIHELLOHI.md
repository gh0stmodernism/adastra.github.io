# Hi hello hi 🖖 

 Ad Astra is a living document created for those who are curious about the world of software engineering from the perspective of a n00b. Hi, hello, hi. My name is Mischa and this is my first githgib project. Testing, 1 2 3...

Ad astra: to the stars. It's a wiktionary meant to help fellow humans from nontraditional backgrounds understand the fundamentals of cs without setting fire to their laptops and running away screaming into the nearest wooded area 🌲 🏃🏼‍♀️

Join me? Cause this shit is hard, fam ⚠️

When I first started my coding journey, I scoured the web for a list of resources to help tame the fire breathing beast of cs concepts 🔥🐉

I remember feeling constantly confused, the logic wasn't something my brain was used to at all. I felt like I signed up for a marathon without even being able to run a mile. Little did I know, this was actually a symptom of imposter syndrome 🚫

At some point I realized this: the human mind is capable of extraordinary things if given the right conditions. Like plants, ideas need certain things to grow. Knowledge requires patience, dedication, and an unwavering refusal to stop. And starting to code could only progress if conditions were met 🌱

Like learning any new language, the basics must be mastered. I had to say hi hello hi, introduce myself to the fundamentals of what I sought to master 📖

I also learned that, like a damn shark, you just keep going. Yeah, it's hard. Everything is, though 🦈

I spent the summer keeping a dictionary of terms I could refer to, introducing myself to concepts hithereto unknown to me and slowly assembling the fascinating, sometimes terrifying and neverending story slash infinity puzzle of all things compsci 💻

I spent the summer of 2018 laying the framework for a foundation that would help support a basic understanding of cs. And I still didn't get it- concepts didn't stick to my brain ❓

I realized I needed to inject some life into what I was trying to learn. I needed metaphors and examples and stories to bring these concepts to life, otherwise they would just collect dust on my mind shelves like useless knick knacks 🏺

I created this project in order to help others get comfortable with the basics and not feel so overwhelmed that they're unable to start 🤯

Analysis paralysis is very real and can make it impossible to take the first steps. I hope Ad Astra can get others through the hardest part of this journey: the very beginning 🚦

We all have to start somewhere, why not the bottom? 🍑

Per aspera ad astra: through hardships to the stars - we got this 🌠
