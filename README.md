De Profundis Ad Astra
'From the depths to the stars'
Ad Astra is a living document created for those curious about the world of software engineering
It is meant to help others, especially those from nontraditional backgrounds, understand the fundamentals of cs without setting fire to their laptops and running away screaming into the nearest wooded area 
When I first started my coding journey, I scoured the web for a list of resources to help tame the confusing fire breathing beast of terrifyingly complex cs concepts. 
Everytime I saw a word or phrase I didn't know I defined it and kept a dictionary of terms I could refer to, introducing myself to concepts hithereto unknown to me and slowly assembling a giant puzzle of new information 
Alas, it took me an entire summer in order to lay the framework for a foundation that would help support a basic understanding of cs  
I created this project in order to help others get comfortable with the basics and not feel so overwhelmed that they're unable to start. 
Analysis paralysis is very real and can make it impossible to start. I hope Ad Astra can get others through the hardest part of this journey: the very beginning. 
We all have to start somewhere, why not the bottom?
