# Ad Astra is a living document created for those curious about the world of software engineering but who don't know where to start

It's meant to help fellow humans from nontraditional backgrounds understand the fundamentals of cs without setting fire to their laptops and running away screaming into the nearest wooded area.  

When I first started my coding journey, I scoured the web for a list of resources to help tame the confusing fire breathing beast of cs concepts.

I spent the summer keeping a dictionary of terms I could refer to, introducing myself to concepts hithereto unknown to me and slowly assembling the giant, fascinating, sometimes terrifying and neverending infinity puzzle of compsci. 

Alas, it took me an entire summer in order to lay the framework for a foundation that would help support a basic understanding of cs. And I still didn't get it- concepts didn't stick to my brain, they just slid down the wall, it was like trying to stick magnets to a wooden wall. 

I realized I needed to inject some life into what I was trying to learn. I needed metaphors and examples and stories to bring these concepts to life, othersie they would just collect dust on the shelves of mind, like useless knick knacks or china no one uses all year except for christmas dinner. 

I created this project in order to help others get comfortable with the basics and not feel so overwhelmed that they're unable to start. 

Analysis paralysis is very real and can make it impossible to start. I hope Ad Astra can get others through the hardest part of this journey: the very beginning.

We all have to start somewhere, why not the bottom?
